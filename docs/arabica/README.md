## System Overview

The Arabica transliteration system is a strict method for transliterating Arabic text into Latin characters, where each Arabic character corresponds to a specific Latin letter, possibly with diacritical marks.

### Key Features

- Preserves the original orthography over pronunciation
- Each Arabic character has a unique representation
- Maintains the structure of the definite article without assimilation
- Uses diacritics to distinguish between similar consonants

## Character Mapping

For the complete character mapping, please refer to the `arabica_system.pdf` document or the reference tables in the web application's help section.

## Implementation Notes

In our application, we've implemented the Arabica system with special attention to:

1. Correctly handling the tāʾ marbūṭa in different contexts
2. Properly formatting the definite article
3. Distinguishing between similar consonants
4. Supporting dialectal features (especially Moroccan Arabic)
