- [x] Create basic templates and static files

### Core Conversion Functionality
- [x] Implement fallback character mapping system
- [x] Create mapping from Arabic chat to Arabica transliteration
- [x] Implement character mapping validation
- [x] Add dictionary-based approach for common words
- [x] Implement correction module for post-processing
- [x] Add experimental Arabic script output
- [ ] Add Docker setup for easier deployment

### CAMeL Tools Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Create Docker container with CAMeL Tools
- [ ] Implement Arabic chat to Arabic script conversion using CAMeL
- [ ] Create mapping from Arabic script to Arabica transliteration

### Basic UI
- [x] Create simple input form for text conversion
- [x] Design conversion result display
- [x] Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
- [x] Implement basic error handling and user feedback
- [x] Add automatic conversion on paste
- [x] Add Arabic script output display

## Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality and Moroccan Arabic Support

### Moroccan Dialect Support
- [x] Research and document Moroccan Arabic specific features
- [x] Implement Moroccan Arabic specific mapping rules
- [x] Create test cases for Moroccan Arabic dialect features
- [x] Enhance common word dictionary with Moroccan terms
- [x] Implement suffix handling for pronoun attachments
- [ ] Add dialect detection functionality

### Customization Options
- [ ] Implement user-definable mapping rules
- [ ] Create UI for custom mapping configuration
- [ ] Add save/load functionality for custom mappings
- [ ] Create preset examples for common conventions

### Validation and Error Handling
- [x] Improve input validation
- [x] Add suggestions for potential errors or ambiguities
- [x] Implement context-aware corrections
- [x] Create visual feedback for problematic conversions
- [ ] Implement a user feedback system for incorrect conversions

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Refinement

### NLP Integration (Potential Enhancements)
- [ ] Integrate fuzzy matching with rapidfuzz for approximate dictionary lookups
- [ ] Add pyarabic for improved Arabic text normalization
- [ ] Explore NLTK or spaCy for morphological analysis
- [ ] Create a hybrid approach combining rule-based and ML techniques

### API Integration Options
- [ ] Add LLM API fallback for unknown words (OpenAI/Anthropic/Mistral)
- [ ] Implement caching for API responses to reduce costs
- [ ] Create a feedback loop to improve dictionary based on API responses
- [ ] Add configuration options for API usage (on/off, rate limits)

### Batch Processing
- [ ] Implement file upload functionality
- [ ] Add support for processing multiple text segments
- [ ] Create batch export functionality
- [ ] Implement progress tracking for large conversions

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Add side-by-side original/converted text view
- [ ] Implement character-by-character mapping visualization
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create a dark mode theme

### Deployment and Distribution
- [ ] Set up Docker configuration
